System Requirements
-------------------

 * Basic Unix tools: `patch`, `md5sum`.

 * `python3` with a working Matplotlib and Numpy.  For Parboil to
   work, it is important that plain `python` is a Python 2.

 * Some Accelerate examples: `accelerate-nbody`,
   `accelerate-crystal`, `accelerate-mandelbrot`, `accelerate-fluid`.

 * `futhark-opencl`.

Maybe more.
